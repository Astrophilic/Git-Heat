# Problem 1 - The Ride

Manish wants to go home in summer vacations and, as his dad isn't a Civil Engineer, he travel through train. But he doesn't know at what time his train arrives. Since he is not as intelligent as you, he needs your help. Give him a list of train schedules for the train number he provides.

## Basic Requirements

**Input** : A 5 digit train number.

**Output** : A file containing [JSON](https://www.copterlabs.com/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/) of the train's schedule. (We'll leave the JSON format details up to you, but they should at least contain stoppages with times. You could further add more details of the train like no. of coaches, classes, ticket prices etc.)

## Next Steps

Once you are done with the basic requirements, get creative! Show the data in a table, export to a sheet, make a browser extension, whatever you can think of.

## Resources

You can use any language you prefer, but we'd recommend python ( Please don't use [python 2](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3)! ) Make sure you read and follow the [coding instructions](../CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md). Here are some resources to get you started:
